About containers
================

Containers are the centre piece of the Anbox Cloud stack. A single
container provides a full Android system.

Each container is hosted on a cluster of multiple nodes provided by the
underlying LXD container hypervisor. The base for a container is an
application. See :ref:`explanation_applications`
for more information about applications.

Data stored in containers
=========================

All containers in Anbox Cloud are ephemeral, which means that as soon as
a container is stopped, all of its data is gone. Anbox Cloud **DOES
NOT** back up any data from the Android or the outer Ubuntu container.
Backup and restore of data must be implemented separately through the
``backup`` and ``restore`` hooks of
:ref:`addons <manage-addons>`.

Possible container status
=========================

Throughout its lifetime, a container moves through different stages
depending on the state itâ€™s currently in.
