# Metrics collection

Anbox Cloud allows you to collect various metrics from a deployment. This includes various metrics about the hardware and how it's being used but also about Anbox Cloud itself, like how many containers are currently running etc.

The following table shows an overview of the metrics available through [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/):

| Name                        | Description                                                 |
| --------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nodes`                     | The number of nodes in the cluster                          |
| `applications`              | The number of applications in the cluster                   |
| `containers`                | The number of containers in the cluster                     |
| `container_boot_time`       | The number of seconds it takes to boot a container          |
| `container_per_application` | The number of containers per application                    |
| `containers_per_status`     | The number of containers per container status               |
| `available_cpu`             | The total number of CPUs available in a node of the cluster |
| `used_cpu`                  | The number of CPUs used in a node of the cluster            |
| `available_memory`          | The total memory available in a node of the cluster         |
| `used_memory`               | The memory used in a node of the cluster                    |


## Requirements

In order to collect various metrics from the LXD machines Anbox Cloud uses [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/). For visualization purposes [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is being used.

To make the deployment of all necessary components easy and straight forward a Juju bundle called `cs:~anbox-charmers/anbox-cloud-metrics` is available in the [Juju charm store](https://jujucharms.com).

By default the bundle deploys [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) into a new machine and will make access to [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) available through a HTTPS secured proxy powered by [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/).

> Tip: When you're structuring your production deployment you may want to follow our instructions for a [customized deployment](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installation-customizing/17747) and directly include any relevant components in your own deployment bundle.

More details about using the deployed metrics collection stack can be found [here](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/monitoring/17785).

## Deployment

You can add the metrics services to an existing Anbox Cloud deployment by executing:

```bash
$ juju deploy cs:~anbox-charmers/anbox-cloud-metrics
```

If you're using the manual Juju provider as described in the [custom install guide](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installation-customizing/17747) you can map the machine defined in the bundle to an existing one on your bundle:

```bash
$ juju deploy cs:~anbox-charmers/anbox-cloud-metrics --map-machines 0=2
```

As in previous deployment steps, you can check the status of the deployment with:

```bash
$ watch -c juju status --color --relations=true
```

When the deployment finished, the status should look like this.
