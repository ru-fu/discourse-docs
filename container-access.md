# Container access

The AMS services enable connecting remotely over a network to containers via [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy).
Scrcpy provides a simple way to display and control containers running on Anbox Cloud remotely.

In the next sections, you will learn how to connect a container running on Anbox Cloud via scrcpy.

## Install Scrcpy

Scrcpy is not available from the official Ubuntu repositories and you have to install scrcpy in one of the following ways:

* Build from source

    * To build scrcpy from the source, please follow the official [guide](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/BUILD.md) to look at how that is done under the Linux environment

* Install scrcpy from the [Ubuntu snap store](https://snapcraft.io)

```bash
$ sudo snap install scrcpy
```

> **Note:** The scrcpy snap package that is published to snap store is a non-official package, you can use it, but it's at your own risk. Because of this, it's highly recommended to build scrcpy from source by yourself.

## Launch Container

To interact with scrcpy, each container must be leveraging proper graphics drivers to work. At best the container is launched with a platform that has a proper GPU supported if the deployment includes the [GPU Support](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/gpu-support/17768). Otherwise, you can use the `swrast` platform instead, which provides a software rendering graphics driver based on [swiftshader](https://swiftshader.googlesource.com/SwiftShader). The swrast platform has been included in the official released images that can be downloaded from an image server hosted by Canonical. We will use the `swrast` platform in the following example.

First, launch a container with the `swrast` platform:

```bash
$ amc launch -s +adb -p swrast -r default
```

The above command will launch a container from the default image. Since scrcpy requires ADB to establish the connection between your host and the container, the ADB service must be enabled by default. With the leading `+` symbol to `adb`, service, it exposes TCP port 5559 on the public address of the node.

Afterwards you can find the network endpoint of the container in the output of the `amc ls` command. The endpoint of ADB service exposed from the running container is available at 10.226.4.200:10000 on the public network.

```bash
$ amc ls
+----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|          ID          |  APPLICATION  |  TYPE   | STATUS  | NODE |    ADDRESS    |                       ENDPOINTS                       |
+----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| bpg8298j1qm4og61p7q0 |    default    | regular | running | lxd0 | 192.168.100.2 | adb:192.168.100.2:5559/tcp adb:10.226.4.200:10000/tcp |
+----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

> **Warning:** Exposing the ADB service over the public internet brings security risks from having plaintext data intercepted by third parties. It's always preferable to run scrcpy [through encrypted SSH Tunnel] if possible.


## Run Scrcpy

Before running scrcpy to connect the running container remotely, you need to establish
the connection between your host and the container through the exposed ADB service via
TCP/IP

```bash
$ adb connect 10.226.4.200:10000
connected to 10.226.4.200:10000
```

After the connection is established, just simply run

```bash
$ scrcpy
INFO: scrcpy 1.10 <https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy>
/usr/local/share/scrcpy/scrcpy-server.jar: 1 file pushed. 9.3 MB/s (22662 bytes in 0.002s)
INFO: Initial texture: 1280x720
```

Then you can interact with the running Android container locally.

## Through SSH Tunnel

In the above example, the ADB service is exposed directly over the internet. This is a major security risk as the ADB connection is not secure. To overcome this security issue, you can use the machine where AMS is running on as relay server to setup a secure and encrypted SSH tunnel by forwarding the exposed ADB TCP port from the LXD machine to your localhost through AMS machine.

To setup a secure connection, the container to be launched won't expose ADB service to the internet.

```bash
$ amc launch -s adb -p swrast -r default
```

As the ADB service is enabled for the launched container but without the leading `+` the endpoint 10.226.4.168:10000/tcp shown below is not exposed to the public network.

```bash
$ amc ls
+----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
|          ID          |  APPLICATION  |  TYPE   | STATUS  | NODE |    ADDRESS    |                       ENDPOINTS                       |
+----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| bpg8298j1qm4og61p7q0 |    default    | regular | running | lxd0 | 192.168.100.2 | adb:192.168.100.2:5559/tcp adb:10.226.4.168:10000/tcp |
+----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

Now forward any connection to port 10000 on your localhost to port 10000 on the remote LXD machine with the address 10.226.4.168 via the AMS machine with the address 10.180.45.183.

```bash
$ ssh -NL 10000:10.226.4.168:10000 ubuntu@10.180.45.183
```

In another terminal, you can connect the running container via ADB with the following command:

```bash
$ adb connect localhost:10000
connected to localhost:10000
```

And run the scrcpy to display and control the Android container.

```bash
$ scrcpy
```
