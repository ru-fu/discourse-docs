## Features

Some features can be conditionally enabled via AMS.

#### System UI

*since 1.10.2*

By default Anbox hides the Android system UI when an application is running in foreground mode. In some use cases it's however required to have the system UI available for navigation purposes. The system UI can be enabled via feature flag, e.g.:

    $ amc config set container.features "enable_system_ui"

The feature flag will be considered by all new launched containers once set.

#### Virtual Keyboard

*since 1.9.0*

The Android virtual keyboard is disabled by default but can be enabled by adding the `enable_virtual_keyboard` feature, e.g.:

    $ amc config set container.features "enable_virtual_keyboard"

Note that you need to manually update the existing applications for the change to take effect. After the application gets updated,  containers that are launched from the latest application version will have the virtual keyboard enabled by default.
