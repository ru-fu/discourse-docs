Launching a container is normally done by another service over the REST API that the AMS service provides. However, the `amc` utility allows launching a container manually for experiments or development purposes. By default, the container will run headless and does not provide an entry point for a user to connect. Containers can be launched for either a registered application or image.

When launching a container from an application or an image directly, a regular container will execute the following steps in order upon its creation:

* Configure network interface and gateway
* Install addons on demand if [launching a raw container](#raw-containers)
* Execute the `install` hook provided by the installed addons
* Expose services on demand
* Execute the `restore` hook provided by the installed addons before launching Android container
* Launch Android container
* Execute the `prepare` hook provided by the installed addons if [launching a raw container](#raw-containers)
* Execute the `backup` hook provided by the installed addons after the container is terminated

The whole launch process will be successful only if all of the above steps succeed.

If something goes wrong during the container launch process, the status of the container changes to `error` status. You can [view the available logs](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/view-the-container-logs/24329) from the container for diagnosing the root cause of the problem.

## Launch application containers

Launching a container for a registered application can be achieved with the
following command:

    amc launch <application id>

As argument, provide the ID of the application you want to launch. You can
list all available applications with the `amc application ls` command:

```bash
+----------------------+----------------+---------------+--------+-----------+--------+---------------------+
|          ID          |      NAME      | INSTANCE TYPE | ADDONS | PUBLISHED | STATUS |    LAST UPDATED     |
+----------------------+----------------+---------------+--------+-----------+--------+---------------------+
| bdp7kmahmss3p9i8huu0 |      candy     | a2.3          | ssh    | false     | ready  | 2018-08-14 08:44:41 |
+----------------------+----------------+---------------+--------+-----------+--------+---------------------+
```
If the application for which you want to launch a container is not yet published (see [Update an application](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/update-an-application/24201) for more details), the launch command will fail as it will only allow launching a container for a published application. However, you can work around this by specifying a specific version of an application:

    amc launch --application-version=0 bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag

<a name="raw-containers"></a>
## Launch Raw Containers

The command for launching a container from an image is:

    amc launch --raw <image id>

As argument, provide the ID or name of the image for which you want to launch a container. See [Manage images](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/managing-images/17758) for more details about how images are managed by AMS.

You can list all available images with the `amc image ls` command:

```bash
+----------------------+---------+--------+----------+----------------------+
|          ID          |  NAME   | STATUS | VERSIONS |       USED BY        |
+----------------------+---------+--------+----------+----------------------+
| bh01n90j1qm6416q0ul0 | default | active | 1        |                      |
+----------------------+---------+--------+----------+----------------------+
```

## Launch container on a specific node

By default, every container is scheduled by AMS onto a LXD node. Alternatively, you can launch a container directly on a specific node:

    amc launch --node=lxd0 bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag

[note type="information" status="Note"]AMS will still verify that the selected node has enough resources to host the container. If not, the container will fail to launch.[/note]

## Launch container with different Anbox platform

By default, every container starts with the `null` platform (see [Anbox Platforms](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/anbox-platforms/18733)). The selected platform cannot be changed at runtime and must be selected when the container is created. For example, you can launch a container with the `swrast` platform like this:

    amc launch -p swrast <application-id>

If you have built your own platform named `foo` and you built it via an addon into the container images, you can launch a container with the platform the same way:

    amc launch -p foo <application-id>
