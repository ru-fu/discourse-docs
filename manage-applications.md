# Managing applications

Applications are one of the main objects AMS manages. A single application encapsulates one Android application and manages it within the cluster. It takes care of installing the supplied application package ([Android Package Kit - APK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package)), to make it available to users. Further AMS manages updates to existing applications, which includes allowing the operator to test new uploaded versions before making them available to any users.

## Application requirements
To run on the Anbox Cloud platform, applications must fulfil a set of requirements. These are:

* The application  **SHOULD**  not download any additional resources on regular startup to contribute to short startup times. If additional resources need to be downloaded, this can be done during the application bootstrap phase.
* The application  **MUST NOT**  require the **Google Play services** to be available as Anbox Cloud does not include them.

If the application fulfils all of the requirements above, it is ready to run on the Anbox Cloud platform. If not, please file a [bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/indore-extern/+filebug) so that we can find out what we can do to still support the application.

<h2 id='heading--create-applications'>Create Applications</h2>

Every application which should be available on an Anbox Cloud cluster must be created first. The internal process will prepare a container based on the currently available image with the application package installed and will use that for any newly launched containers to support fast boot times.

### Preparation

To create an application, you need an Android package (APK) with support for the target architecture. Additionally, you must select one of the available instance types for the application. The instance type defines CPU/RAM constraints put onto the container launch for the application.

> **Note:** See [Instance Types](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/instances-types-reference/17764) for a list of available instance types.

To create a new application, you must first create a manifest file to define the various attributes the new application should have. The manifest is a simple [YAML](http://yaml.org/) file and looks like this:

```yaml
name: candy
instance-type: a2.3
image: default
boot-activity: com.canonical.candy.GameApp
required-permissions:
  - android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
  - android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
addons:
  - ssh
tags:
  - game
extra-data:
  com.canonical.candy.obb:
    target: /data/app/com.canonical.candy-1/lib
  game-data-folder:
    target: /sdcard/Android/data/com.canonical.candy/
watchdog:
  disabled: false
  allowed-packages:
    - com.android.settings
services:
  - name: adb
    port: 5559
    protocols: [tcp]
    expose: false
resources:
  memory: 4GB
  disk-size: 8GB
```

The available attributes are listed in the following table:

Name          | Value type | Description
--------------|------------|-------------------------
`name`          | string     | Verbose name of the application. The following special characters are not allowed: `< > : " / \ &#124; ? *`, as well as space
`version`       | string     | Version to encode with the application. Maximum length is 50 characters.
`instance-type` | string     | Container instance type that all containers created for the application will use.
`required-permissions` | array of strings | List of permissions to automatically grant to the application. See [Android Permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview) for a list of available permissions. If `[*]` was given, all required runtime permissions for the application will be granted on application installation.
`image` (optional) | string     | Name or ID of an image to be used for the application. The default image is used if empty.
`addons` (optional) | array      | List of addons to be installed during the application bootstrap process.
`tags` (optional) | array      | List of tags to be associated with the application.
`boot-package` (optional) | string     | Package to launch once the system has booted (default: package name retrieved from the APK if APK file is present).
`boot-activity` (optional) | string     | Activity of boot package to launch once the system has booted (default: main activity as defined in the application manifest).
`video-encoder` (optional) | string     | Video encoder to be used by a container launched from the application  (default: gpu-preferred). Possible values are: gpu, gpu-preferred, software
`watchdog` (optional)    | map        | Watchdog settings to be configured on application installation.
`services` (optional)    | array      | Services to be provided from the installed application.
`resources` (optional)   | map        | Resources to be allocated on application installation.
`extra-data` (optional)  | array      | List of additional data to be installed on application installation.

#### Image

The `image` attribute defines which image the application is based on. If left empty, your application will be based on the default image. See [Image Management](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/managing-images/17758) for more details on this. Available images on your installation can be listed with the following command:

    amc image list

#### Video encoder
A video encoder type can be specified through `video-encoder` field in the manifest file when creating an application, so that a container launched from the application can use a GPU or software video encoder according to different scenarios.

Name                     |  Description
-------------------------|-------------------------
`gpu`                      |  A GPU-based video encoder
`gpu-preferred`  |  A GPU-based video encoder if GPU slots are not used up, otherwise, fall back to use a software-based video encoder
`software`            |  A software-based video encoder

When `gpu` video encoder is specified in the manifest, AMS can fail to create an application if:
 - All GPU slots are used up by running containers.
 - There is no GPU support across the entire LXD cluster.

#### Watchdog settings

The `watchdog` attribute includes the following field definitions:

Name                     | Value type | Description
-------------------------|------------|-------------------------
`disabled`               | Boolean    | Toggle application watchdog on or off (default: false)
`allowed-packages`       | array of strings | Besides the boot package, list of packages to be allowed to display in the foreground

When a container is launched, Anbox enables an application watchdog by default for the installed package unless it's disabled explicitly with:

```yaml
name: candy
instance-type: a2.3
image: default
watchdog:
  disabled: true
```

If one of the following scenarios occurs, the watchdog will be triggered. The container will be terminated and ends up with `error` status.

- The application crashes or an [ANR](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/anr) is triggered.
- The application is not in the foreground when an application which is not listed in `allowed-packages` was brought to the foreground and gained the focus.
- The boot package or activity is invalid.
- One of the `allowed-packages` is invalid.

The rules forbid launching another activity, not part of the installed package or listed allowed packages. Launching activities of the same package is allowed.

Supplying `['*']` to the `allowed-packages` when the watchdog is enabled allows any application to be displayed in the foreground without triggering a watchdog.

#### Services

A container launched from the installed application can expose `services` you want to make accessible from outside the container. You must define the following properties for each service:

Name           | Value type | Description
---------------|------------|-------------------------
`name`         | string     | Name of service
`port`         | integer    | Port number to be exposed by the service
`protocols`    | array of strings | Protocols to be used by the service (Possible values are: tcp, udp)
`expose`       | Boolean    | Expose service to be accessible externally or internally

#### Resources

If the [`instance-type`](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/instances-types-reference/17764) that is provided by AMS doesn't meet the criteria that the installed application requires to function, you use the `resources` directive to override the predefined resources in `instance-type`.

Name           | Value type | Minimum value  | Description
---------------|------------|----------------|-------------------------
`cpus`         | integer    |     1          | Number of vcpu cores
`memory`       | string     |     3 GB       | Memory to be assigned to the application
`disk-size`    | string     |     3 GB       | Disk size to be assigned to the application
`gpu-slots`(optional) | integer |     0      | Number of GPU slots to be assigned to the application

In the following application manifest file, the application is created with `a2.3` instance type, which will be assigned 2 vcpu cores, 3 GB memory and 3 GB disk size. With the following resources defined in the manifest file, the allocated memory and disk size will end up at 4 GB and 8 GB, respectively, on application installation and the number of vcpu cores remains the same:

```yaml
name: candy
instance-type: a2.3
resources:
  memory: 4GB
  disk-size: 8GB
```

If all required fields (`cpus`/`memory`/`disk-size`) of `resources` are supplied in the application manifest, the `instance-type` field is no longer needed. Even if the `instance-type` field is provided, it will be overridden by `resources` in the end upon application installation.

#### <h4 id='heading--extra-data'>Extra data</h4>

Some Android applications which contain large program assets such as graphics or media files use so-called [OBB](https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files) files to store additional data. These data files are separated from the APK and saved onto the external or internal SD card of an Android device. The `extra-data` field can be used in this case to install an APK with separated OBB files or any other additional data into the Android system.

Each item of `extra-data` should be declared as follows:

```yaml
<name>:
    target: <target-path>
    owner:  <uid>:<gid> # optional
    permissions: <file-permission> # optional
```

The fields have the following purpose:

Name                     | Value type | Description
-------------------------|------------|-------------------------
`name`                   | string     | Name of file or directory to be installed into the Android file system
`target-path`            | string     | Target location for the file or directory
`owner` (optional)       | string     | Owner assigned to the target file or directory in the Android file system
`permissions` (optional) | string     | Permissions assigned to the target file or directory in the Android file system

`permissions` represents [Linux file permissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions) in octal notation.

It's recommended to let Anbox choose the right values for `owner` and `permissions` instead of manually providing them. If `owner` and `permissions` are not specified, the following default values will be used:

Name          | App data installation directory | Type | Value
--------------|---------------------------------|------|--------
|`owner`       | sdcard      | File | package_uid:sdcard_rw
|              | sdcard      | Dir  | package_uid:sdcard_rw
|              | system data | File | package_uid:package_gid
|             | system data | Dir  | package_uid:package_gid
|`permissions` | sdcard      | File | 0660
|              | sdcard      | Dir  | 0771
|              | system data | File | 0660
|              | system data | Dir  | boot package folder -> 0700, nested folders of boot package folder -> 0770

Each item (file or folder) declared in the `extra-data` field of the manifest yaml file should be placed in a directory called `extra-data`.

For security reasons, the target location of the files and directories listed in the `extra-data` section is restricted to a few specific locations in the Android file system. These are:

* `/sdcard/Android/obb/<apk-package-name>`
* `/sdcard/Android/data/<apk-package-name>`
* `/data/app/<apk-package-name>`
* `/data/data/<apk-package-name>`

The manifest and extra data in our example are placed next to the application package, which must be named **app.apk**:

```bash
$ tree
.
├── app.apk
├── extra-data
│   ├── com.canonical.candy.obb
│   └── game-data-folder
│       └── data.bin
└── manifest.yaml
```

### From a directory

When creating an application from the folder path, the location should contain the required components for the creation:

* `manifest.yaml`
* `app.apk`
* `extra-data` (optional)

With everything in place the application can be created:

    amc application create <path/to/application-content>


When the `create` command returns, the application package is uploaded to the AMS service and the bootstrap process is started. The application is not yet ready to be used. You can watch the status of the application with the following command:

```bash
$ amc application show bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag
id: bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag
name: candy
status: initializing
published: false
config:
  instance-type: a2.3
  boot-package: com.canonical.candy
versions:
  0:
    image: bf7u4cqkv5sg5jd5b2k0 (version 0)
    published: false
    status: initializing
    addons:
    - ssh
    boot-activity: com.canonical.candy.GameApp
    required-permissions:
    - android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
    - android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
    extra-data:
      com.canonical.candy.obb:
        target: /data/app/com.canonical.candy-1/lib
      game-data-folder:
        target: /sdcard/Android/data/com.canonical.candy/
    watchdog:
      disabled: false
      allowed-packages:
      - com.android.settings
    services:
    - port: 5559
      protocols:
      - tcp
      expose: false
      name: adb
resources:
  memory: 4GB
  disk-size: 8GB
```

Once the status of the application switches to `ready`, the application is ready and can be used.

### From a tarball

An application can also be created from a tarball file. The tarball file must be compressed with bzip2 and must follow the format of the application package as described before.

For example, a tarball can be created with:

```bash
$ tar cvjf foo.tar.bz2 -C <package-folder-path> app.apk extra-data manifest.yaml
```

Once the tarball is created, you can create the application:

    amc application create foo.tar.bz2

The AMS service now starts the application bootstrap process as described before.

> **Note:** Due to Snap strict confinement, no matter which approach you're taking, the folder or tarball file must be located in the home directory.

### Bootstrap process

Whenever creating an application either from a directory or a tarball, AMS will perform a bootstrap process, which builds the application and synchronises it across all LXD nodes in the cluster. There are major benefits the bootstrap process provides:

  * It enables AMS to launch a container for an application without installing the APK every time.
  * It dramatically speeds up startup time of a regular container.

Furthermore an application is synchronised within the LXD cluster, which enables AMS to continue to work when nodes are being removed from the cluster through [Node Management](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/manage/managing-lxd-nodes) or lost from the cluster unexpectedly.

A temporary base container will be created and used for the bootstrapping during the application creation:

```bash
$ amc application create foo.tar.bz2
applications:
- bq789q0j1qm02cebmoeg
$ amc ls
+----------------------+-------------+------+----------+------+---------------+-----------+
|          ID          | APPLICATION | TYPE |  STATUS  | NODE |    ADDRESS    | ENDPOINTS |
+----------------------+-------------+------+----------+------+---------------+-----------+
| bq78a3oj1qm02cebmof0 |    candy    | base | prepared | lxd0 | 192.168.100.2 |           |
+----------------------+-------------+------+----------+------+---------------+-----------+
```

In general, the bootstrap process goes through the following steps in order:

![application-bootstrap|690x467](upload://haAJJ8p8ZEQXmsvrVb3HOHhl1io.png)

  * Configure network interface and gateway
  * Apply any pending Ubuntu system security updates
  * Install [addons](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/managing-addons/17759) via the `install` hook provided by each addon listed in the application manifest file
  * Launch Android container
  * Install the APK provided by the application
  * Grant the application permissions as requested in the application manifest
  * Install the extra data as listed in the application manifest
  * Execute the `prepare` hook provided by each addon listed in the application manifest

If one of the steps fails, AMS will interrupt the bootstrap process and make the entire process fail. As a result, the status of the base container will be marked with `error` and the application's status will end up with `error` as well.

> **Note:** An application crash or ANR upon APK installation will cause the bootstrap process to terminate abnormally and the status of application is set to `error` too.

When a base container runs into an error status, you can see what has gone wrong there by checking the error message with `amc show <application ID>`:

```bash
id: bq78a3oj1qm02cebmof0
name: ams-bq78a3oj1qm02cebmof0
status: error
node: lxd0
created_at: 2019-08-09T02:11:33Z
application:
    id: bq6ktjgj1qm027q585kg
network:
    address: ""
    public_address: ""
    services: []
stored_logs:
- container.log
- system.log
- android.log
error_message: 'Failed to install application: com.foo.bar: Failed to extract native libraries, res=-113'
config: {}
```

Alternatively, [check the container logs](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/managing-containers/17763#heading--show-container-logs) to troubleshoot problems in the container.

When the application bootstrap succeeds, the base container is automatically removed and the status of the application changes to `ready`. The application is then ready to be used.

## Wait for applications

The `amc wait` command instructs AMS to wait for an application to reach a specific condition. If the condition is not satisfied within the specified time (five minutes by default), a timeout error will be returned by AMS.

The supported conditions for an application are as follows:

Name            |  Value
----------------|------------
`instance-type` |  Supported instance type. See [Instance Types](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/instances-types-reference/17764) for a list of available instance types.
`addons`        |  Comma-separated list of addons.
`tag`           |  Application tag name (deprecated, use `tags` instead).
`tags`          |  Comma-separated list of tags.
`published`      |  "true" or "false" indicating whether the application is published.
`immutable`     |  "true" or "false" indicating whether the application is changeable.
`status`        |  Application status, possible values: "error", "unknown", "initializing", "ready", "deleted"

One example of using the `amc wait` command is to wait for the application bootstrap to be done, since the application bootstrap is performed asynchronously by the AMS service and takes some time to process. The application cannot be used until the bootstrap is complete and the status is marked as `ready`.

    amc wait -c status=ready bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag

## Update applications

Updating an existing application works similar to creating a new one. Each time an existing application is updated, it is extended with a new version. All versions that an application currently has are individually usable, but only one can be available to users.

When you want to update an existing application with a new manifest or APK, provide both in the same format as when the application was created. The `amc application update` command accepts both a directory and an absolute file path.

From a path:

    amc application update bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag $PWD/foo

From a file:

    amc application update bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag foo.tar.bz2

AMS will start the update process internally. You can watch the status of the new version with the following command:

    amc application show bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag

The output shows detailed information about the application and all of its versions:

```bash
id: bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag
name: candy
status: ready
published: false
config:
  instance-type: a2.3
  boot-package: com.canonical.candy
versions:
  0:
    image: bf7u4cqkv5sg5jd5b2k0 (version 0)
    published: false
    status: active
    addons:
    - ssh
    boot-activity: com.canonical.candy.GameApp
    required-permissions:
    - android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
    - android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
    extra-data:
      com.canonical.candy.obb:
        target: /data/app/com.canonical.candy-1/lib
      game-data-folder:
        target: /sdcard/Android/data/com.canonical.candy/
    watchdog:
      disabled: false
      allowed-packages:
      - com.android.settings
    services:
    - port: 5559
      protocols:
      - tcp
      expose: false
      name: adb
  1:
    image: bf7u4cqkv5sg5jd5b2k0 (version 0)
    published: false
    status: active
    addons:
    - ssh
    boot-activity: com.canonical.candy.GameApp
    required-permissions:
    - android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
    - android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
    extra-data:
      com.canonical.candy.obb:
        target: /data/app/com.canonical.candy-1/lib
    watchdog:
      disabled: false
      allowed-packages:
      - com.android.settings
    services:
    - port: 5559
      protocols:
      - tcp
      expose: false
      name: adb
resources:
  memory: 4GB
  disk-size: 8GB
```

Each version gets a monotonically increasing number assigned (here we have version `0` and version `1`).
In addition, each version has a status which indicates the status of the bootstrap process AMS is performing for it. Once an application version is marked as `active`, it is ready to be used.

The most important part of an application version is the `published` field. If a version is marked as published, it is accessible to users of Anbox Cloud. Generally when launching containers by using the AMS REST API, if no specific application version is given, the last published version of an application is used to create the container.

You can mark an application version as published with the following command:

    amc application publish bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag 1

To revoke an application version, use the following command:

    amc application revoke bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag 1

If an application has only a single published version and that version is revoked, the application can't be used by any users anymore. AMS will still list the application but will mark it as not published as it has no published versions.

Each version takes up space on the LXD nodes. To free up space and remove old and unneeded versions, you can individually remove them, with the only requirement that an application must have at least a single version at all times. Removing a specific application version is possible with the following command:

    amc application delete --version=1 bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag

The command will ask for your approval before the version is removed as it might affect your users. If you want to bypass the check, you can add the `--yes` flag to the command.

## Disable automatic application updates

*since 1.11.0*

AMS automatically updates an application whenever any of its dependencies (parent image, addons, global configuration) changes. This produces a new version for the application, which is automatically published if the `application.auto_publish` configuration item is enabled.

In some cases, an automatic update is not wanted. To support this, AMS allows disabling automatic application updates via the `application.auto_update` configuration update.

To disable automatic updates:

    amc config set application.auto_update false

To enable automatic updates:

    amc config set application.auto_update true

When automatic updates are disabled, applications must be manually updated for any changed dependencies. To do this, use the following command:

    amc application update <application id or name>

This will initiate the update process and create a new application version.

## Change image an application is based on

The image an application is based on can be changed with the following command:

    amc application set com.canonical.candy image <image name or id>

Changing the image will cause AMS to generate a new version for the application. Previous versions will continue using the image the application used before.

## Delete applications

When an application is no longer needed, it can be fully removed from Anbox Cloud. Removing an application will cause all of its versions to be removed, including all of its currently active containers. Please be extra careful as this might affect your users if any are still using containers of the application you want to remove.

Once you're sure you want to remove the application, you can do so with the following command:

    amc application delete bcmap7u5nof07arqa2ag

The command will ask for your approval before the application is removed. If you want to bypass the check, you can add the `--yes` flag to the command.

## Filter applications

By default, `amc application ls` shows all applications. If you want to search for specific types of applications, e.g. only show a group of applications with a particular tag, you can use the `--filter` flag to filter and group applications.

The filter flag accepts a key-value pair as input for the filter. The following attributes are valid keys:

Name            |  Value
----------------|------------
`instance-type` |  Supported instance type. See [Instance Types](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/instance-types-reference/17764) for a list of available instance types.
`addons`        |  Comma-separated list of addons.
`tag`           |  Application tag name (deprecated, use `tags` instead).
`tags`          |  Comma-separated list of tags.
`published`      |  "true" or "false" indicating whether the application is published.
`immutable`     |  "true" or "false" indicating whether the application is changeable.
`status`        |  Application status, possible values: "error", "unknown", "initializing", "ready", "deleted"

To list all applications with a tag called "game":

    amc application ls --filter tags=game

To apply multiple filters, pass multiple flags:

    amc application ls --filter published=true --filter tags=game

This will query all published applications that have the tag "game".
